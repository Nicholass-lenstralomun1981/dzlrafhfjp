Just got out of Nonnas like I stepped into a whirlwind but forgot to check the weather app. The theater was so loud, like popcorn 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ling in my head but, oh, the cozy chaos of it, like sitting in a grandma's kitchen while she tests her sixth espresso of the morning. My back’s aching and crunching the stale kernel crumbs underfoot is like a weird cereal for my ears. 

The  ... it was heavy, you know? Like a pot of sauce bubbling over, can't quite clean it up but you love the mess. That dinner table scene — like a symphony of arguing and laughing so real you could almost smell the garlic through the screen. Felt like a memory you never lived, soaked in nostalgia you didn’t know you signed up for.

> Oh, remember, you wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Just thought of it now, maybe after the theater hubbub has died down. It's like trying to catch fireflies with a holed jar, you know?

And that scene where they’re all dancing in the kitchen, like spirited little kids forgetting the mess they’re in. My mind was half there and half thinking about the popcorn wedged in my molars. Wishes could fix everything, but here you are, knee-deep in broken dreams and burnt lasagna. 

It was like the Godfather meets a warm blanket, odd but you’re wrapped snugly in absurd mafioso casserole. Somebody said I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again because there's something soothing about the chaos. 

Something powerful too, how they spun tales so sweet and bittersweet, tangling through my brain like a cat tangled in yarn that only it can unravel. 

Can barely remember how it ended, just this glow somehow — but my mind's more like... static on an old TV. Need to walk it off maybe, unwind this tangled 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 from my mind.

```

{
    int thoughts = 1;
    while (thoughts < dreamState)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Espresso dreams...);
        thoughts++;
    }
}
